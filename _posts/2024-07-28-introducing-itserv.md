title: Introducing ITSERV
---

As someone who has experienced first-hand the difficulty small-medium businesses experience when adapting new technologies, I've always had to learn from scratch the best way to select and optimise our IT solutions. Although we did eventually set things up - This proved to be a time-consuming task with much of it being spent navigating licensing, billing, and configuration.

That was almost a decade ago.

Yet there still isn't a reseller and MSP that can satisfactorily support SMEs in their digitalisation journey. Without an "IT guy", it remains difficult to navigate through partners to understand what you're purchasing and how to get the most out of your purchase.

### We're here for all teams - big and small

Hence, ITSERV was created. A reseller and managed service provider that learns and understands the needs of all organisations; From the budget-constraint no-IT team businesses, to larger organisations who need a partner line for major vendors.

We distinguish ourselves by focusing on understanding the desires and constriants of each business, and architecting and proposing solutions that best fit those needs. Through this, we aim to create a more cohesive working working relationship that can adapt to the businesses as they grow.

### Leveraging partner connections

Another upside our clients get is the ability to  leverage us as a single funnel for multiple vendors. This means that you can receive a single, predictable itemised invoice every cycle from us. No more guesswork on what you're paying for and which service you're subscribed to.

We also act as another layer of support to help troubleshoot issues with your solutions. With our partner relationships, we can also escalate to our tier-1 distributors and vendors should the issue be more complex.

Even if you prefer to configure and setup things yourself, it's always nice to have other's expertise to support you during those times. With us, you get a multi-layered support channel with engineers beyond ITSERV itself.

### Closing remarks

Through this, ITSERV is a formal manifestation of what should've been available to all - An affordable consultancy and reseller who can support you in your digital journey.

We're a small team to continues to consult and support new and existing clients as we seek to expand in this space, and we hope you will consider us for your next step towards going digital.
